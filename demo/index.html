				<h2>What does NC State research do? (h2)</h2>
		
				<p>NC State is a pre-eminent research enterprise that grasps problems and solves them. Our approach 
					crosses academic boundaries, employs cutting-edge ideas and technologies, engages partners and 
					seeks solutions that can change the world.</p>
			
				<p>We’re finding new ways to bridge the disciplines every day, from creating new fields with Faculty 
					Clusters hiring or launching a whole new College of Sciences to make collaboration easier. Society’s 
					grand challenges don’t mimic the neat organizational structure of a traditional university. Take hunger, 
					for example: as the climate changes, the population grows and arable land shrinks, it’s going to 
					take an innovative approach to ensure reliable plant-based food sources. NC State researchers in biology, 
					computer engineering and environmental engineering are merging botany and big data to determine why some 
					plants wither under stress and some thrive.</p>
		
				<h3>Solve Problems (h3)</h3>
		
				<p>Wherever it occurs &mdash; in a lab on campus, in a field in rural North Carolina, on an island in the 
					Pacific &mdash; NC State research aims for the same destination: the real world. Our faculty and students 
					engage with real problems, and they find real solutions. Our researchers have developed energy-saving smart 
					transformers and life-saving bomb sensors, handheld radiation detectors and self-healing bandages. Our 
					research gets results.</p>
					
				<p>To truly grasp an idea, you have to apply it. Research plays a central role in filling out our students’ 
					understanding of what they learn from our world-leading faculty. Research is inherent to the NC State experience, 
					for the freshman studying sociology as well as the postdoctoral researcher in a biomedical engineering lab. Our 
					students support faculty research on sustainable energy, secure computing, human health and a range of other topics. 
					On the research projects they lead, NC State students have developed solutions to problems large and small, from 
					improving sanitation in the developing world to making a better peanut butter jar for your kitchen. </p>
					
				<h4>Innovation is a team sport. (h4)</h4>
				
				<p>Innovation is a team sport. That’s why we reach out to partners of every type in our search for global solutions. NC 
					State’s research campus &mdash; Centennial Campus &mdash; is a national model and home to more than 60 government, industry and 
					nonprofit partners. We’re working with the National Science Foundation to develop self-powered medical centers and 
					with dozens of industry partners at the Nonwovens Institute to drive a textiles manufacturing renaissance. In every 
					partnership, we work for more than our own interests: we seek solutions that will serve all of society.</p>
		
				<p>When faculty, students and partners work across disciplines to solve serious problems, the result of their work 
					benefits everyone. That’s the net effect and constant goal of NC State research: to create economic societal and 
					intellectual prosperity.</p>

				<p>Innovation is a team sport. That’s why we reach out to partners of every type in our search for global solutions. NC

				<h2>What does NC State research do? (h2)</h2>
		
				<p>NC State is a pre-eminent research enterprise that grasps problems and solves them. Our approach 
					crosses academic boundaries, employs cutting-edge ideas and technologies, engages partners and 
					seeks solutions that can change the world.</p>
			
				<p>We’re finding new ways to bridge the disciplines every day, from creating new fields with Faculty 
					Clusters hiring or launching a whole new College of Sciences to make collaboration easier. Society’s 
					grand challenges don’t mimic the neat organizational structure of a traditional university. Take hunger, 
					for example: as the climate changes, the population grows and arable land shrinks, it’s going to 
					take an innovative approach to ensure reliable plant-based food sources. NC State researchers in biology, 
					computer engineering and environmental engineering are merging botany and big data to determine why some 
					plants wither under stress and some thrive.</p>
		
				<h3>Solve Problems (h3)</h3>
		
				<p>Wherever it occurs &mdash; in a lab on campus, in a field in rural North Carolina, on an island in the 
					Pacific &mdash; NC State research aims for the same destination: the real world. Our faculty and students 
					engage with real problems, and they find real solutions. Our researchers have developed energy-saving smart 
					transformers and life-saving bomb sensors, handheld radiation detectors and self-healing bandages. Our 
					research gets results.</p>
